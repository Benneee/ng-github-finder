## Github-Finder

Using the GitHub API, GitHub-Finder provides a means to search for GitHub users and provides extra information for the users found.

## Getting started

1. cd into project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:

```sh
npm start
```

## Deployed site

[ng-github-finder](https://github-finder-sage.now.sh)

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run generate -- component <name>` to generate a new component. You can also use
`npm run generate -- directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Tools

1. Angular v8
2. Bootstrap
3. NgBootstrap
4. ngx-toastr
